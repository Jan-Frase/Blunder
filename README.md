# â™žâ™œ Blunder â€” Chess Engine â™”â™—  
No longer being worked on because i decided to switch to rust. 

New engine is called [Mouse](https://github.com/Jan-Frase/Mouse).

## ðŸ“œ Overview  
A fully functional UCI chess engine built from scratch in java.
It works fairly well (good enough to beat me anyways).
